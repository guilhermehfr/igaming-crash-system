# Crash Game — Frontend

React + TypeScript + Vite frontend for the iGaming Crash System.

## Dev Setup

```bash
bun install
bun run dev
```

## Connecting to Backend

### Demo (single-service via Docker)

```bash
# From repo root — start Postgres + demo backend
bun demo:up

# Serve frontend pointing at the demo service
cd frontend
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:4003 bun run build && bun preview
```

The demo runs on host port **4003** (no Kong, no Keycloak, no RabbitMQ). Postgres runs on host port **5433** to avoid conflicting with the full stack.

### Development (full stack via Kong)

All traffic (REST + WebSocket) goes through Kong via Vite proxy:

- `/games/*` → `http://localhost:8000` (Kong) → `http://games:4001`
- `/wallets/*` → `http://localhost:8000` (Kong) → `http://wallets:4002`
- `/socket.io/*` → `http://localhost:8000` (Kong, WebSocket) → `http://games:4001`

Configured in `vite.config.ts`:

```ts
server: {
  proxy: {
    "/games": "http://localhost:8000",
    "/wallets": "http://localhost:8000",
    "/socket.io": {
      target: "http://localhost:8000",
      ws: true,
    },
  },
}
```

WebSocket connects through the same proxy (same-origin):

```ts
import { io } from "socket.io-client";
const socket = io(undefined, { transports: ["websocket"] }); // dev: same-origin via Vite proxy
```

### Production

All traffic goes through Kong. Point the frontend to your gateway domain:

```ts
const socket = io("wss://api.example.com");
```

Services are not publicly exposed — only accessible via Kong through the Docker network.

## State Management

4 Zustand stores manage client state with selector-based re-render isolation:
- **auth-store**: User identity, login/logout, persisted to localStorage
- **game-store**: Round state, multiplier, bets, crash history (ephemeral)
- **balance-store**: Wallet balance number (ephemeral)
- **seed-store**: Provably fair seed hash and history, persisted to sessionStorage

TanStack Query fetches wallet balance with 15s staleTime and refetchOnWindowFocus.

## Auth Flow

Auth state managed by Zustand `auth-store` (persisted to localStorage via `zustand/middleware/persist`).

### Development
The `apiFetch` helper reads `X-User-Id` and `Authorization: Bearer <token>` from the store's persisted data. Kong forwards the identity to the service:

```ts
fetch("/games/current", {
  headers: { "X-User-Id": "player-1" },
});
```

On first login, `auth-store.login()` calls `ensureWalletCreated()` using a direct `fetch` (not `apiFetch`) with explicit `X-User-Id` header — wallet is keyed by userId only.

### Production
JWT from Keycloak is required. Kong validates the JWT, extracts the `sub` claim, and injects `X-User-Id` + `X-Gateway-Authenticated` headers. Client-provided identity headers are stripped by Kong — spoofing is not possible.

## WebSocket Events

| Event | Payload | When |
|-------|---------|------|
| `round:state-changed` | `{ roundId, state, crashPoint }` | BETTING→RUNNING→CRASHED |
| `round:multiplier-updated` | `{ roundId, multiplier }` | Every 100ms during RUNNING |
| `round:bet-placed` | `{ roundId, bet: { id, userId, demoSessionId, amountInMainUnit } }` | Bet placed |
| `round:bet-cashed-out` | `{ roundId, bet: { id, userId, multiplier, winnings, amountInMainUnit } }` | Cash out |
| `round:crashed` | `{ roundId, crashPointMultiplier, statistics }` | Round ends |
